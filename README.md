May I kindly offer some instructions that might be helpful?
I understand that you may already be familiar with the process, but I thought it might be useful to provide some additional guidance that could make things easier. 
If so, please read below instructions per project:


reactapp

 - run a terminal inside this folder
 
 - for first time, please run npm install
 
 - run npm start
 
 
 
 webapi
 
  - run a terminal inside this folder
  
  - please execute dotnet run. Note: If reactapp is running https please execute dotnet run --launch-profile https (Restart/Refresh the reactapp once done)
  
  
 webapitest
  
  - run a terminal inside this folder
  
  - please execute dotnet test
  
  
 Alternatively, you may also run the rcg.sln using vs
 
 
 Thank you for considering these instructions. I genuinely hope that they prove helpful to you.
